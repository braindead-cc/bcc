# The LPTSTR Brainfsck Toolchain

Brainfsck is an extremely simple, safe, and fast language for developing
maintainable software.

## Features

### Simplicity

The language itself consists of just 8 commands, which can be learned by
going through the documentation in less than a minute. This results in
simple, readable, and maintainable code.

Despite being simple, Brainfsck was designed to give power to the developer.
Anything you can do in any other language, you can theoretically do in
Brainfsck.

### Safety

- no `NULL`.
- no variables.
	- no global variables.
- bounds checking.
- no memory allocations.

### Performance
- as fast as C, as long as you use the C backend when compiling.
- no memory allocation.
- compiles to native binaries with no dependencies.
